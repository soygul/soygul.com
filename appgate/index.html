    <a href="https://www.cryptzone.com/products/appgate">AppGate</a> (Application Gateway) is a VPN/network access control solution.
    It provides granular and secure access to applications and services hosted anywhere.
    I will start with the interesting bits and jump directly to the tech stack and my role in the project, followed by the architectural overview.
  </p>

  <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Backend</strong>: No publicly disclosed info so cannot mention this part.</li>
    <li><strong>Management Console</strong>: Based on my open source project <a href="https://github.com/soygul/koan">KOAN</a>. AngularJS and Node.js.</li>
    <li><strong>Client Core</strong>: Xamarin and C#. Shared code on all supported dekstop and mobile platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Client UI</strong>: Polymer app running in Electron on desktops, WebView on mobiles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I have personally worked on all aspects of the project during the design and development, which took over 4 years.
    Starting with recruitment and architectural decisions, to the development of first 3 versions.
    Server side was developed as micro-services after consulting with expert opinions and our consensus.
    Management Console is forked from my open source project <a href="https://github.com/soygul/koan">KOAN</a>.
    Same goes for Android and iOS clients, which I forked from my existing WebView based projects.
    You can check out the Android client yourself:
