<h1>Privacy Policy for All My Apps</h1>

(Last updated: 12 Sep 2017)

None of my apps which has this privacy policy applied collects or distributes any personally identifiable information, except noted below.

<h2>Apps with Ads</h2>

Any of my apps with ads use AdMob SDK for delivering ads to users. AdMob is a Google service and you can review relevant Google privacy policy on the subject.

<h2>Apps with Login</h2>

Any of my apps with a 'login' feature will collect your name/e-mail address to uniquely identify you. This is done so that you can access your account from multiple devices and your relevant information (game score, etc.) will be readily available on all devices.

<h2>All Apps</h2>

All of my apps collect device specific information upon application crash to identify and solve the issue related to that device. Data collected will be limited to the applications own data plus non-personally identifiable generic device information (i.e. amount of RAM, device model, version numbers of relevant apps, etc.).

<h2>Contact</h2>

If you have a specific request or question about this privacy policy, you can contact me through the we site that this privacy policy is hosted at.
